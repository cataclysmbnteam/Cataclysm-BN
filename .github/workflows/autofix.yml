            The Autofix app has found [code style violation][code-style] and automatically formatted this Pull Request.

            ### I locally edit my commits (e.g: git, github desktop)

            Please choose following options:

            <details><summary>I'd like to accept the automated commit</summary>

            1. Run `git pull`. this will merge the automated commit into your local copy of the PR branch.
            2. Continue working.

            </details>

            <details><summary>I do not want the automated commit</summary>

            1. [Format your code locally](https://docs.cataclysmbn.org/en/contribute/contributing/#code-style), then commit it.
            2. Run `git push --force` to force push your branch. This will overwrite the automated commit on remote with your local one.
            3. Continue working.

            </details>

            If you don't do this, your following commits will be based on the old commit, and cause **MERGE CONFLICT**.
