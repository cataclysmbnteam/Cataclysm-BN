        Crash: if your problem refers to a crash, please add the following files to the "Additional Context" paragraph:
        - From the /config folder (you can zip them both together):
            - crash.log file.
            - debug.log file.
        - Your save file (zipped)

        - note #1: you can drag and drop files in this issue post!
        - note #2: it is very important for us that you provide a save file in case of a crash. It really helps the developers
            to reproduce the bug and fix it. If possible, try to provide a save file that occurs in the right conditions, just
            before the crash happens.
