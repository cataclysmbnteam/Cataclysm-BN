        - note #1: you can drag and drop files in this issue post!
        - note #2: it is very important for us that you provide a save file in case of a crash. It really helps the developers
            to reproduce the bug and fix it. If possible, try to provide a save file that occurs in the right conditions, just
            before the crash happens.
