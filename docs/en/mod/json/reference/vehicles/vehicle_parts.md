"noise_factor": 15,           // Optional field, defaults to 0. Multiple engine power by this number to declare noise.
"damaged_power_factor": 0.5,  // Optional field, defaults to 0. If more than 0, power when damaged is scaled to power * ( damaged_power_factor + ( 1 - damaged_power_factor ) * ( damaged HP / max HP )
"muscle_power_factor": 0,     // Optional field, defaults to 0. If more than 0, each point of the survivor's Strength over 8 adds this much power to the engine, and each point less than 8 removes this much power.

"fuel_options": [ "soul", "black_soul" ] // Optional field, defaults to fuel_type.  A list of words. An engine can be fueled by any fuel type in its fuel_options.  If provided, it overrides fuel_type and should include the fuel in fuel_type.

"bash" : 3,
"cut" : 3,
"acid" : 3,
"stab" : 3,
"heat" : 3,
"cold" : 3,
"electric" : 3
