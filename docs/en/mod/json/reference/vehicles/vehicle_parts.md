"breaks_into" : [             // When the vehicle part is destroyed, items from this item group (see ITEM_SPAWN.md) will be spawned around the part on the ground.
  {"item": "scrap", "count": [0,5]} // instead of an array, this can be an inline item group,
],
"breaks_into" : "some_item_group", // or just the id of an item group.

"backfire_freq": 20,          // Optional field unless backfire threshold > 0, then mandatory, defaults to 0. One in X chance of a backfire.
"noise_factor": 15,           // Optional field, defaults to 0. Multiple engine power by this number to declare noise.

"fuel_options": [ "soul", "black_soul" ] // Optional field, defaults to fuel_type.  A list of words. An engine can be fueled by any fuel type in its fuel_options.  If provided, it overrides fuel_type and should include the fuel in fuel_type.

"propeller_diameter": 0.5,    // Optional field, diameter of propeller
```

### Integrated Tools

```json
"integrated_tools": [ "foo" ],
```

An option array of tools that this vehiclepart will provide for crafting purposes, compare and contrast `crafting_pseudo_item` for furniture. Requires the vehiclepart to have the `CRAFTING` flag to function.

Most legacy crafting vehiclepart flags have been removed and should be replaced with equivalent tools. The `WATER_PURIFIER`, `FAUCET` and the `WATER_FAUCET` flags, which provide specific functions on examine, have been retained.

```json
"integrated_tools": [ "pot", "pan", "hotplate" ],  // Replaces the `KITCHEN` flag
"integrated_tools": [ "dehydrator", "vac_sealer", "food_processor", "press" ],  // Replaces the `CRAFTRIG` flag
"integrated_tools": [ "chemistry_set", "electrolysis_kit" ],  // Replaces the `CHEMLAB` flag
"integrated_tools": [ "forge" ],  // Replaces the `FORGE` flag
"integrated_tools": [ "fake_adv_butchery" ],  // Replaces the `BUTCHER_EQ` flag
"integrated_tools": [ "kiln" ],  // Replaces the `KILN` flag
"integrated_tools": [ "soldering_iron", "welder" ],  // Replaces the tools
"integrated_tools": [ "water_purifier" ],  // Replaces the tools, but not the ability to purify water in vehicle tanks, of the `WATER_PURIFIER` flag
```

### Part Resistance

```json
"all" : 0.0f,        // Initial value of all resistances, overridden by more specific types
"physical" : 10,     // Initial value for bash, cut and stab
"non_physical" : 10, // Initial value for acid, heat, cold, electricity and biological
"biological" : 0.2f, // Resistances to specific types. Those override the general ones.
"bash" : 3,
"cut" : 3,
"acid" : 3,
"stab" : 3,
"heat" : 3,
"cold" : 3,
"electric" : 3
```

]
                                           /* Important! Vehicle parts must be defined in the same order you would install
                                            * them in the game (ie, frames and mount points first).
                                            * You also cannot break the normal rules of installation
                                            * (you can't stack non-stackable part flags). */
