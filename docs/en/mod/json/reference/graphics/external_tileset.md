# External Tilesets

`data/json/external_tileset` is used for content specific to Bright Nights which are not presently
in primary tilesets such as UDP or Ultica, for which `looks_like` is inadequate to depict the
content to a satisfactory degree. It functions using the `mod_tileset` feature, applying any desired
new sprites or overriding sprites to the specified tileset.

The primary advantage of this method is to set aside sprites so they won't interfere with updating
the tilesets themselves (as their sources are in the repositories of the tileset authors), and
likewise ensuring anything specific to BN won't be accidentally erased, like it would if a tileset
update was submitted to BN after these editing these sprites our versions of the tilesets. It also
covers divergences in content were, by nessecity, a different sprite is a better fit.

## Undead People

The following is a current list of sprites this folder adds to the UDP tileset, in which files and
for what purpose. This is currently the only tileset with external_tileset coverage, but sprites for
Ultica are planned for the future.

### External_Tileset_DP_Normal.png

- Furniture form of steam turbines, to be deconstructed for advanced steam engine. Content specific
  to BN.
