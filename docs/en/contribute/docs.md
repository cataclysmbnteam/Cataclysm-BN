> [!NOTE]
>
> - `.md` in `CONTRIBUTING.md` stands for markdown files
> - `.mdx` in `docs.mdx` stands for [MarkDown eXtended](https://mdxjs.com)
>   - it's a superset of markdown with javascript and [jsx component][jsx] support
>   - they are a bit more complicated but allows to use interactive components

## Local development

> [!NOTE]
>
> This section assumes you have some knowledge of [git](https://git-scm.com) and [javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). Of course, you can learn them as you go.

To run the documentation site locally, you need to:

- install [deno](https://deno.com) to format and generate automated documentation

### Setup dev server

```sh
(Cataclysm-BN) $ deno task docs serve

# or if you are already inside the docs directory
(Cataclysm-BN/docs) $ deno task serve
```

You will be able to access the documentation site at `http://localhost:3000`. The dev server will automatically reload when you make changes to the documentation.

### Automated page generation

Lua and CLI docs are generated automatically from the source code. To generate them, go to project root and run:

```sh
(Cataclysm-BN) $ deno task docs:gen
```
