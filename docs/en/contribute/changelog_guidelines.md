# Changelog Guidelines

PR title follows [Convensional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for easier
changelog generation. The format is one of:

```
<Type>: <PR subject>
<Type>(<Scope>, <Scope>, ...): <PR subject>
```

For Example, a PR title can be:

```
feat: add new mutation
feat(port): port mutation description from DDA
```

The PR title should be easy to understand for players at a glance. It's recommended to use imperative and descriptive title (`<verb> <noun>`) like:

```diff
- feat: rebalancing some rifles
+ feat: nerf jam chance of m16 and m4
```

before: it's hard to know whether they are buffed or nerfed, and which rifles are changed unless reading the full PR description.
after: it's easy to understand what exactly is changed from the title itself.

## Type

The type is the first word in the PR title. They specify the type of change being made. When in
doubt, use `feat` for new features, and `fix` for bugfixes. Here are some frequently used
categories:

### `feat`: Features

New features, additions, or balance changes.

### `fix`: Bugfixes

Anything that fixes a bug or makes the game more stable.

### `refactor`: Infrastructure

Make development easier without changing its behavior. For example:

- `C++` refactorings and overhaul
- `Json` reorganizations
- `docs/`, `.github/` and repository changes
- other development tools

### `build`: Build

Improve build process:

- more robust
- easier to use
- faster compile time

### Others

- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (whitespace, formatting, etc), usu. fixing JSON formatting.
- `perf`: Performance Improvements
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `ci`: Changes to CI process
- `chore`: Other changes that don't fit into any of the above categories
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit

## Scopes

1. Use them inside parentheses after the category to further narrow the scope of your PR.
2. There are no limits to number of scopes.
3. They are optional, but recommended.
4. these are only guidelines, not rules. choose the best one for your PR freely!
