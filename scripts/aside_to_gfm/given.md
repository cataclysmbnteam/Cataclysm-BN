some text

:::note

- `.md` in `CONTRIBUTING.md` stands for markdown files
- `.mdx` in `docs.mdx` stands for [MarkDown eXtended](https://mdxjs.com)
  - it's a superset of markdown with javascript and [jsx component][jsx] support
  - they are a bit more complicated but allows to use interactive components

[jsx]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html

:::note{title="for X11"}

```sh
$ cmake -DLEGACY=ON -B profiler/build -S profiler # if you're using X11
```

tracy uses wayland by default, if you want to use X11, you need to add `LEGACY=1` flag.
