    // How loud a sound is at 1 meter away (or how loud an ambient sound is), in Decibels Sound Pressure Level (dB spl, or just dB from now on), 0 - 191
    //
    // As a general rule, 0-40 dB is very quiet to quiet, 60-80 dB is noisy, 100 dB is very noisy,
    // 120 dB is intolerable and is the low threshold for instantaneous hearing loss and pain, 140 dB is the high threshold for pain, 150 dB is garunteed temporary hearing loss, 160 dB is a general ballpark for how loud unsuppressed gunfire is for the shooter, 180+ dB will start to knock humans unconscious and cause injury.
    // Above 191 dB a pressure wave is a supersonic shockwave, and does not get to be a "sound wave" until it ceases being supersonic. Outside of good conditions humans generally will not notice sounds below 20 dB. The ambient noise level of a quiet room is around 40 dB, a quiet street is around 50 dB.
    // For a more detailed example list, see https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/sound-pressure-d_711.html
    //
    // 0 dB spl reference is 2x10^-5 Pascals, which is an accademic and industry standard. This is the threshold of human hearing at 1kHz.
    // dB spl can be used to find the pressure reduction over distance of a sound wave.
    // Taking 1 tile to be ~1 meters, in an open field 10 tiles distance reduces perceived dB by 20, 100 tiles distance reduces dB by 40, etc.
    // Adding dB spl has to be done by the root mean square method (100dB + 100dB + 100 dB = ~104.7 dB spl) as it is itself a rms value of pressure fluctuations.
    // Adding several dB values together results in something usually almost identical to the largest source, (100 dB + 100 dB + 113 dB = 114.3 dB)
    // so we will generally just take the largest volume if its 10 greater than other sounds.
    //
    // Decibels are a relative unit of measurment that expresses the ratio of two values of some quantity on a logarithmic scale.
    // By itself it is unitless, since it is just a ratio. It is used because there is such a vast range of technically audible sounds, 0.00002 Pa to above 101000 Pa
    // Unfortunantly there are three different accoustic quantities that all use some version of dB,
    // are related to eachother but very different quantities, and are mistaken for one another in almost all non-engineering or non-accademic contexts.
    // To make it even worse, its still not uncommon to find mix ups in technical sources or to just have all three called dB and expecting you to just know which one they mean.
    // It is very common for audio electronics manufacturers, especially headset or microphone manufacturers, to just call all three properties sound intensity.
    // Saying someone probably got something wrong is not really an insult here, its just a fact of life with accoustics because of how poorly communicated so much information is.
    // (Be very, very careful second guessing musicians/sound techs however.)
    //
    // *Sound Pressure Level* (sound pressure, dB spl) is the rms pressure deviation due to a pressure wave (sound wave) from a reference pressure at some specific point.
    //      Proper unit is Pascals, This is what we are using. dB spl = 10*Log10(P^2/Pref^2) = 20*Log10(P/Pref).
    //      When discussing pressure levels in accoustics unless someone explicitly says they are referencing the peak amplitude of a sound wave, what they are refering too is the sound pressure level.
    //      Sound Pressure level is a root means square value, and is the effective pressure of that sinusoidal pressure wave at some point as it flip flops from positive to negative amplitude a couple thousand times a second.
    //      Almost all reference dB values for sounds are in sound pressure level, health regulations/medical figures, and this is what is measured by a point sensor like a microphone or decibel meters.
    //      Doubling the pressure of a sound wave increases the dB value by 6. A difference of 60 dB is a 1024x increase in pressure!
    //      Maximum dB spl in air is 191 dB, the maximum peak (not rms) dB is 194.
    //
    //      If a source says that the sound pressure doubles every 3 dB, they gotten something wrong and have likely conflated sound pressure level with sound intensity level.
    //      This is probably the second most common mistake when discussing sound/accoustics, second only to not listing reference distance for dB spl measurments. dB spl measurments are useless without this.
    //
    // Sound Power Level (dB swl) is a the rate at which sound energy changes with time across some surface, and is effectively a vector quantity.
    //      Proper unit is in Watts dB swl = 10*Log10(W/Wref)
    //      Very useful from an engineering/physics standpoint and still useful to the end user, as it only depends on the noise source and is independant of the acoustic enviornment.
    //      But we dont really care about that here, and dont need to deal with all of the extra math and calcs that we would have to add.
    //
    // Sound Intensity Level (dB sil) is the power caried by sound waves per unit area in a direction perpendicular to an area.
    //      Proper unit is Watts/meter^2 (I). This is a field quantity and we are not trying to simulate the universe. dB sil = 10*Log10(I/Iref)
    //      Sound intensity doubles for every 3 dB sil.
    //      This value cannot really be directly measured, and is only really useful from an engineering/physics standpoint.
