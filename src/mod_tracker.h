/**
 * Mod Tracking:
 *
 * These functions live here to provide various JSON-loaded entities
 * with the ids of the mods that they are from.
 *
 * To subscribe, a JSON-loaded entity simply needs to have a
 * 'std::vector<std::pair<(string or int)_id<T>, mod_id> src;' member.
 * (As well as storing their id in an 'id' member of either string or int id type)
 *
 * If the entity is loaded with generic_factory, no further changes are needed.
 * If the entity is not loaded with generic_factory, 'assign_src()' must be called sometime
 * after the  'id' member has been assigned.
