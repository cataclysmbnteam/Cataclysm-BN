# History
Magic has been around for longer than written word, though of course it was a major boon to it. Magic, to an extent, even predates language itself. However, naturally, it was only with the development of language that magic began to refine itself past its most base levels.

Throughout much of ancient history, magic was present and powerful. The ancient Greeks oft saw magic all around them, and not just metaphorically. The term magic itself, alongside the idea of mages, comes from Latin. The ancient Sumerians had their rituals, and so did the Egyptians. Japan has its many Kamis and yokai, China has its Wuism. Magic was everywhere.

However, there is of course one major period that one thinks of when they think of magic. Unfortunately, this was also the last great period of magic historically. The Medeival Era was one of the greatest heights that magic reached, and yet also the great Cataclysmic downfall of it. It contains such wonderous figures as Merlin himself, and it is the time period that so many stories about our art take place in. Magic was capable of accomplishing so much. Yet the end of the Middle Ages also brought with it the end of widespread magic. Persecution against our art reached new heights. The Church condemned us, brought on the witch hunts. So much was lost, including the strength of magic itself. Any surviving mages either went in seclusion themselves, or hid their practicing of the arts carefully. However, the stronger of them felt the very strength of magic slipping away and waning.

Following the medieval era, magic was a pale ghost of its former self. With mages being so secretive, advancements came slower than had been seen in centuries. What could once be accomplished with ease now took immense strength and control over mana. The New World, it was hoped, might finally bring freedom and safety from persecution. In a land of new opportunities, surely there would be new opportunities for magic users!

Our hopes were brutally smashed against a rock, then set alight while they were gasping due to their collapsed lungs, and then tossed in a hole to suffer and wish for death to take them already while crows pecked at their eyes and dogs gnawed at what remained of their flesh.

Yet, once the dust had settled from Salem, some brave souls remained despite the deaths of their peers. Some came over on the ships carrying filthy masses from the Old to the New. Our hopes would not come to fruition for a couple centuries, but we were more than willing to wait. Especially those of us who had seen what the world was like a few centuries ago.

In the modern era, we have finally in a sense achieved our goal. The smolder of the Church has long since cooled to less menacing embers. More importantly, the Neopagans have revived many of the long-dead and dormant traditions, though naturally with their own flair and some misconceptions/innacuracies from filling in the spots that were burned out. There has been a sort of resurgence of practicing magic amongst some, namely the Wiccans. Especially important is the fact that the Church simply hasn't as much a sway over the common people's lives as it once held, especially given the rise of non-believers.

Now, we come to present-day. Something has gone royally wrong with the veil between worlds. Demons and netherspawn certainly came across in the olden days, but not in **these numbers**. *Something* has infected and taken over a majority of humans. Fortunately, this world is not entirely lost. For with this apparent tearing of the veil, **an incredible resurgence of the magic itself has arisen!** Magic has returned in all of its glory, leaving any who has the potential with a very powerful tool to defend themselves against the horrors of this world. Including the appearance of magical fauna once thought extinct, or merely fantastical. Only time will tell whether this is a sign of a new golden age of magic, but I certainly hope it is.

# Practice

The ability to practice magic has always been uncommon. Even during the Middle Ages, it was impressive and uncommon to have any real ability for magic. A truly powerful mage, rather than a hedge mage, was something a family was proud of. Mages were very often highly respected members of society, whether they were awed or feared. Mages have only gotten rarer, though there seemed to be a bit of an uptick around the time of Neopagan revivals.

Magic practitioners were and still are often divided into distinct classes and schools. Especially in the olden times, many mages specialized in but a single school of magic. However, as time has gone on magic users have gotten to be more and more jack-of-all-trades in their repetoires. It is notable, however, that naturally the lesser in ability a mage was, the more likely they were to not specialize in a single school. Jack-of-all-trades being a master of none is irrelevant when one couldn't be a master of anything anyway. Better to be well-rounded in your lesser spells when they are all you can learn.

Naturally, mages desired companionship by other mages, especially so following persecution. Druid Circles and Covens are natural examples, of course. These groups also often helped contribute to magical advancements that would simply be infeasible to be made on one's own. And, of course, for casting certain spells.

### Class Characteristics

- Magus: Force and Waves. This can be described as Time, Light, Gravity, and Force. Magus spells are the most versatile of the classes, and it also usually has the more difficult to learn spells.
- Animist: Spirits. As Magus is the physical universe, animist is the metaphysical. Usually misunderstood and as such has a bit of a stigma throughout history as necromancers. This class also features blood magic, which is another reason it has a stigma.
- Kelvinist: Heat and Cold spells. Can also produce light to a lesser degree.
- Stormshaper: Wind, weather, and electricity. Most of these spells are really loud.
- Technomancer: Invention. This usually manifests as spells that summon arms and armor, holograms, tools, and buffs that focus on the human condition. The Technomancer rune is also uniquely versatile, allowing for much wider ability for magic to work with mundane inventions. Technomancer became a lot more popular with the invention of electricity, as it has a finer control of electricity than stormshaper, though it does not have the power.
- Earthshaper: Stone, dirt, geography, things to do with the earth. The spells often focus on melee and defense. Lava is a high-tier earthshaper thing as well. This class features spells that use stamina as their energy source.
- Biomancer: Flesh mage. Manipulating the caster's flesh is easier but higher tier spells can manipulate others' flesh. Features Acid.
- Druid: Plant mage. Communes with nature. The typical "druid" of old is usually a combination of this class and Earthshaper. Has a slight secondary affinity with water.
