# RPG System

An RPG progression mod for Cataclysm: Bright Nights that adds a LitRPG-style experience system.

## Features

- **Experience & Leveling**: Gain XP from killing monsters, level up to 40
- **Classes**: Choose from 3 base classes (Warrior, Mage, Scout) and 6 prestige classes at level 10
- **Traits**: Unlock powerful traits
- **Stat Points**: Assign free stat points

## Balance

Worth ~25 character creation points. Weak early game, powerful late game. Not designed to be used with "Stats through Kills" mod.

## TODOs

Have more interesting and dynamic stats and traits. They are all currently implemented either using `mod_` functions in lua, or using static mutation JSON bonuses. We could definitely add some more BombasticPerk style traits.

Also, probably much of this is unbalanced.
