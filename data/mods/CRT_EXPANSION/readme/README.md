# The C.R.I.T. Mod
The core of The C.R.I.T mod is that it currently adds an armor set, mildly OP gas mask and transforming vest, some gun mods, a new melee/tool and a new material. The items also use a lot of higher end materials such as superalloy, rubber (the "new" material), the lesser used hardsteel and also neoprene.

This mod also adds a few new classes to Bright Nights. To name a few: the C.R.I.T. Medic, C.R.I.T. Commanding Officer, C.R.I.T. Automatic Rifleman, C.R.I.T. Grunt, C.R.I.T. NCO, C.R.I.T. ROTC member, and also the highly feared (OP) C.R.I.T. Spec Ops.

I tried to keep the professions revolving around slightly upgraded army gear and as "balanced" as possible except for the C.R.I.T Spec Ops which is for trying out the new items and being stupid powerful and the Juggernaught for being a Juggernaught.

I can't fix some things like the toolmods attatching to the vest and gasmask, but that doesn't hurt the game (my mod already breaks it) and it's more of a cheap way to progress instead of getting a UPS, even though it still drinks a ton of power.

# Extended Techniques
More techniques, more play styles. Tries to open up melee and offer more than "does it have a reach attack?" or "does it have rapid strikes?" to make melee interesting.
