# No-Hope

The mod is based on the old lore where there was a full-scale war with China with many months of
preceding marauding and civil disorder. Thus the world with the mod will be much more damaged
overall, there will be much less loot etc.

Mod has two major goals. The first and the most important one is to make Cataclysm harder and
harsher. To achieve this goal, I decreased loot spawn, made most houses spawn damaged, as well as
most cars, and some other changes.

The second goal is to return back the original lore and content to the game. To achieve this goal, I
returned many removed content, returned old descriptions to monsters, items etc, returned old
snippets, and some other changes.

Despite I'm standing for realism side in "realism vs. gamism" debate in vanilla, in this mod I'm
changing my priority for balance and gameplay. If realism is standing in the way of FUN, I'm
throwing the realism out.

# List of features

- Returned most of the cut "sillynonsense" and other inappropriate (for vanilla) content, including,
  but not limited to: Rivtech and Leadworks guns, flaming melee weapons, tainted tornado and sewer
  brew, Fusion Blaster CBM, makeshift scrap firearms, underbarrel flamethrower, atomic cars, laser
  turret (rewrote description to mention it's working not on the solar panels, but rather on compact
  yet powerful storage batteries; updated drop list to reflect that), chickenbot, tankbot and tripod
  and made it spawn in some military locations, bone armor (for vehicles and player).

- Radically decreased amount of ammo drop from turrets: 5.56 - 120, 7.62 - 100, .50 - 90.

- Returned old names and descriptions for turrets (they are manufactured by General Atomics and
  Leadworks), security-bot (Northrop), power armor (DoubleTech).

- Radically nerfed the ESAPI vest - no more "better-than-power-armor" stats. Also significantly
  decreased chance to spawn it on zombie soldiers (from 90% to 30%).

- Made ordinary walls hard to set on fire. Based on my old closed PR
  (https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/pull/15537). Now you can't set it on fire using a
  simple lighter.

- Updated domestic mapgen pallette so now any window in most houses will spawn shattered with 70%
  chance or fully smashed to frame (20% chance). Intact windows will spawn only with remaining 10%
  chance. The same for wooden doors: 60% chance to spawn open (imagine it was pryed open), 20%
  chance to spawn closed but damaged, 10% chance to spawn smashed to frame. Intact doors will spawn
  only with remaining 10% chance.

- Removed most of the guaranteed loot spawn in every location in the game. The chances to spawn
  guaranteed loot was dropped to 50-80%.

- Returned mooseâ€™s legendary aggression. Now it's the good old machine of destruction as it used to
  be.

- Made hiding additional options when examining workbench-type furniture on by default.

- Made zombies don't revive by default. Reviving has some serious issues that can't be easy fixed,
  so until these issues are to be resolved, I'm disabling zombie resurrection in my mod.

- Removed all one-tile puddles of infinite water in all forest types.

- Made all gas stations have 0 - 5000 units of fuel instead of vanilla 40000 - 50000 units. Also
  made almost all locations in mapgen have the same 0 - 5000 units of fuel, including avgas. Also
  made almost all cars have zero fuel. There are places and cars where you could still find fuel,
  they are just very rare.

- Integrated "Cars to Wrecks" mod. Also manually checked most of the cars spawn in mapgen and set
  them to spawn at least slightly damaged. Intact cars now are much, much harder to find, though not
  impossible.

- Integrated "Mutant NPCs" mod. I like the idea, it's fun, so why not?

- Integrated "Extra Bandits" mod. Extra bandits of all sorts everywhere is exactly the thing I'd
  expect to emerge after the apocalypse.

- Made bows and crossbows great again. Now they are more powerful in general: deal more damage (and
  don't rely on critical shots to be useful), have much lower dispersion, and have lower strength
  requirements.

- Added shrub with bee hive furniture from my old PR
  (https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/pull/35323/).

- Removed all turrets from military vehicles.

- All LMOE shelter now have a rather high chance to spawn bandits inside.

Slightly reduced stamina burn rate while walking.

- Reduced chance to drop military gear from zombie soldiers.

# Translation

To use translated version, simply unpack the corresponding archive (for example, "Russian.7z)" to
the mod's main folder and overwrite all files when asked to. Important: don't let the mod have
several versions of the same files (translated and un-translated ones), there should be only one
version.
