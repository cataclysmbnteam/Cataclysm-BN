Rather than exploring an underground dungeon, with a limited area on each level, you are exploring a truly infinite world, stretching in all four cardinal directions.  In this survival roguelike, you will have to find food; you also need to keep yourself hydrated and sleep periodically.  It's based on principle of realism, so expect all hardships you'd expect in life in a survival situation, and at least a dozen more from the eldritch and sci-fi nature of the Cataclysm itself.",
      "While Cataclysm has more tasks to keep track of than many other roguelikes, the near-future setting of the game makes some tasks easier. Firearms, medications, and a wide variety of tools are all available to help you survive."

If you leave it be, the affected body part will develop serious infection, and it's status bar color will change to green.  At this stage it is too late to disinfect the wound, and you need antibiotics to fight it.  Your body will try fight the infection by itself, and daily antibiotics intake may keep you alive long enough for it to happen.  Even weaker antibiotics can still help prevent it from getting worse, but you ultimately have to wait it out in the hope that you will not die in the process.",

Your initial storage is limited, and a backpack, trenchcoat, or other storage medium will let you carry a lot more. Finding a weapon is important, but not a first priority; frying pans, butcher knives, and more are common in houses; hardware stores may carry others.  Initially keep the guns as a last resort trump card. Ammo is scarce, while zombies are plenty, and unwanted attention may be more you can handle.",

      "Avoid combat whenever you can.  Run if you have to, but control your stamina, as zombies are inexhaustible unlike yourself.  Combat is always risky, and sometimes one wrong step may be your last.  Therefore in most cases you gain nothing from combat, unless you are equipped for it and killing zombies will help you achieve something.",
      "Combat is much easier if you can fight just one monster at once.  You can sometimes kite singled-out zombies.  Use doorways as a choke point or stand behind a window and strike as the zombies slowly climb through. Be wary - in number they will push through anyway.  Never be afraid to just run if you can outpace your enemies. Irregular terrain, like forests, may help you lose monsters.",

Staying dry is important, especially if conditions are so low that they would cause frostbite.  Use a towel to dry yourself if you are wet from the rain.  If you're having trouble staying warm over night, make a pile of clothing on the floor to sleep on.  Finding a pillow and a blanket for your bed is always good for the quality of your sleep.  If you can't have those, improvise, even a chair in a basement is better then a wet ground in the field.  Finding or making a shelter with a place to sleep is very important to your survival.",

Safe speed is how fast you can drive without damaging the engine and maximum speed is how fast you can drive at the engine's maximum output.  Acceleration is how fast your vehicle can increase speed each turn.  Cargo volume is how much cargo you can store and how much stuff you have in your vehicle, mass is how much the vehicle weighs, and the Status and Wheels give a summary of the vehicle condition and wheel condition.  There are also fuel indicators on the lower right that give an estimate of how quickly your fuel will run out, though keep in mind that accelerating uses more fuel than maintaining your speed.",
      "Air drag, water drag, rolling drag, and static drag are all values that influence your vehicle's safe and maximum speed.  The interaction of drag and engine power is complicated, but generally speaking, more powerful engines will make your vehicle go faster but also consume fuel faster.",
      "Air drag increases as your vehicle gets wider or has more parts that increase the vehicle's height like full boards, aisles, or turrets.  It also increases as the vehicle has a less aerodynamic profile, such as having exposed passengers or full boards at the front of the vehicle.  Air drag strongly influences vehicle speed, especially at high speeds and on aircraft.",
      "Rolling drag increases with vehicle weight and wheel count.  Rigid wheels have less rolling drag per wheel than inflatable wheels, but weigh more so rolling drag may still increase when moving from inflatable wheels to rigid wheels.  Tank treads have enormous rolling resistance and are very heavy, so tanks have a lot of rolling resistance.  Rolling drag influences vehicle speed, but less than air drag does, especially at high speeds.",
      "Vehicles that can move in water have a water drag.  Water drag increases with vehicle width and draft, and draft increases with vehicle weight but is reduced by adding more boat boards and by widening or lengthening the vehicle.  Water drag has enormous effect on vehicle speed in the water.  See the section on water vehicles for more about draft and water drag.",
      "Static drag includes things like plows, and directly reduces your vehicle's acceleration and top speed.",
      "Offroad is a rough estimate of how efficient your vehicle moves when not on pavement.  Your vehicle's safe speed, top speed, and acceleration are multiplied by roughly the off-road percent when your vehicle is not on pavement.  Off-road percentage decreases as vehicle mass increases and increases with the size and number of wheels.  Tank treads will give your vehicle an excellent off-road percentage but your vehicle will be slower due to the treads' very large rolling drag.",

You can even create a vehicle from scratch, by using the Construction (<press_construction>) menu to 'Start a New Vehicle' when they have a frame available.  Tuning a vehicle for speed, fuel consumption, off-road capacity, protection against threats, and cargo capacity is a complicated process.",

      "Different parts are more or less likely to take damage in a collision.  Rams and armor plating will take most of the damage from direct impacts, and rams and shock absorbers both reduce damage caused to internal tiles.  Enemies underneath you can directly attack your vehicle's internal tiles, so watch out for turrets and zombie sharks.",
      "BOATS AND AMPHIBIOUS VEHICLES",
      "You can use boat hull parts to create boats or amphibious vehicles that can move between water and land.",

If the height of the watertight hull is less than the vehicle's draft, then water will flow into your vehicle and it will sink and be destroyed if it goes into deep water.  If your vehicle's draft is less than the height of the watertight hull, your vehicle will not take on water and will not sink in deep water.",
      "Draft is determined by length and width of your vehicle, the mass of your vehicle, and the percentage of the vehicle's underbody covered in boat hulls.  In general, a vehicle should be able to float if it's mass in tons is less than a quarter of the value of its length and width.  A boat that is 5 tiles wide and 9 tiles long has a good chance of floating if all of its underbody is covered in boat boards and it weighs less than 10 tons.",
      "Increased draft increases water drag, and water drag reduces a vehicle's speed in water.  If you want your boat to go fast, make it as light as possible.",
      "Amphibious vehicles have both wheels and boat hulls.  As long as your amphibious vehicle has enough wheels on land and enough boat hulls to not sink in deep water, you can freely transition from land to water.  However, most amphibious vehicles are much slower in water than they are on land, so be careful when entering water to not leave your cruise control speed above your vehicle's safe water speed or you can burn out your engine!",
      "AIRCRAFT",
      "You can build and occasionally find flying vehicles such as airplanes, blimps, and helicopters.  Each one has its pros and cons, and can be installed alongside boat hulls, wheels, and even one another.  Aircraft are typically designed to be as lightweight as possible to save on fuel, though this can also make the vehicle less able to withstand damage.  It is often important to decide whether a vehicle will be sturdy or lightweight, and to build and modify it accordingly.  Certain advanced materials and parts can allow for both.",
      "Airplanes are typically fast and fuel efficient, but need to be moving at a certain speed to stay airborn, and their wing shape and size can impact this.  Blimps tend to be very large, since each balloon provides only a small amount of lift, but they cost nothing to maintain their height, allowing for large mobile bases that never touch the ground and use almost no fuel.  Helicopters are extremely fuel inefficient and require much more engine power than planes or blimps, but they can be smaller than blimps and more maneuverable than planes.  You can install airship balloons onto a helicopter or airplane to improve their fuel efficiency and lift, however."

      "<color_light_gray>( Handguns</color>\nHandguns are small weapons held in one or both hands.  They are much more difficult to aim and control than larger firearms, and this is reflected in their poor accuracy.  However, their small size makes them appropriate for short-range combat.  They are also relatively quick to reload and use a very wide selection of ammunition.  Their small size and low weight make it possible to carry several loaded handguns, switching from one to the next once their ammo is spent.",
      "<color_green>( Crossbows</color>\nThe best feature of crossbows is their silence.  The bolts they fire are only rarely destroyed; if you pick up the bolts after firing them, your ammunition supply will last much longer.  Crossbows suffer from a very long reload time (modified by your strength); plus, most only hold a single round. \nFor this reason, it is advisable to carry a few loaded crossbows.  Crossbows can be very difficult to find; however, it is possible to craft one given enough Mechanics skill.  Likewise, it is possible to make wooden bolts from any number of wooden objects, though these are much less effective than steel bolts.

Bows are two handed and require the user to have a certain strength level.  If you do not have enough strength to draw the string back, you will fire at a reduced effectiveness.  This reduces the reload and fire speeds and decreases the range of the arrows fired.  \nMost normal bows require strength of at least 8, others require an above average strength of 10, or a significant strength of 12. However, unlike crossbows, bows are usually not very accurate and require high skill to use effectively.  Bows use the archery skill.",
      "<color_red>( Shotguns</color>\nShotguns are some of the most powerful weapons in the game, capable of taking out almost any enemy with a single hit.  Birdshot has spread, allowing you to hit multiple enemies in a cone of fire.  However, birdshot and 00 shot are very ineffective against armor, and some armored monsters might shrug off both completely.  Shotgun slugs and flechette rounds are the answer to this problem; slugs also offer much better range than shot.\nThe biggest drawback to shotguns is their volume.  They are very loud, and silencers for them are rare.  A shot that kills one zombie might attract three more!  Beware of that.",
      "<color_cyan>( Submachine Guns</color>\nSubmachine guns are small weapons (some are barely larger than a handgun), designed for relatively close combat and the ability to spray large amounts of bullets.  However, they are more effective when firing single shots, so use discretion.  They mainly use pistol calibers such as 9x19mm and .45 ACP.  They reload moderately quickly, are decently accurate, and are suitable for close or medium-long range combat, but also don't hit as hard as rifles.",
      "<color_brown>( Sniper and Marksman Rifles</color>\nSniper and marksman rifles are popular for their superior range and accuracy.  What's more, their scopes or sights make shots fired at targets at very long range as accurate as those with a shorter range.  Unlike assault rifles, sniper and marksman rifles usually have no automatic fire.  They are also may be slow to reload and fire, so when facing a large group of nearby enemies, they are not the best pick.",
      "<color_blue>( Assault Rifles</color>\nAssault rifles are similar to hunting rifles in many ways; they are also suited for long range combat, with similar bonuses and penalties.  Unlike hunting rifles, assault rifles are capable of automatic fire.  Assault rifles are less accurate than hunting rifles, and this is worsened under automatic fire, so save it for when you're highly skilled. \nAssault rifles are an excellent choice for medium or long range combat, or even close-range bursts again a large number of enemies.  They are difficult to use, and are best saved for skilled riflemen.",
      "<color_light_red>( Machine Guns</color>\nMachine guns are one of the most powerful firearms available.  They are even larger than assault rifles; however, they are capable of holding 100 or more rounds of highly-damaging ammunition.  They are not built for accuracy, and firing single rounds is not very effective.  However, they also possess a very high rate of fire and somewhat low recoil, making them very good at clearing out large numbers of enemies.",
      "<color_magenta>( Energy Weapons</color>\nEnergy weapons is an umbrella term used to describe a variety of weapons which fire lasers, plasma, or other energy attacks.  They are mostly prototypes that started to appear in military use just prior to the start of the apocalypse, and as such are very difficult to find.\nEnergy weapons have no recoil at all; they are nearly silent, have a long range, and are fairly damaging.  The biggest drawback to energy weapons is their power drain, requiring a UPS or to be attached to an electronic vehicle turret to work.  They are also rare and difficult to find or make."

      "Q: How can I cure a fungal infection?\nA: Royal jelly, the Blood Filter bionic, and some antifungal chemicals and pills can cure fungal infection.  You can find royal jelly in the bee hives which dot forests.  Antifungal chemicals to cure the fungal infection can either be found as random loot or made from other ingredients.",
      "Q: How do I get into science labs?\nA: You can enter the front door if you have an ID card by examining (<press_examine>) the keypad.  If you are skilled in computers and have an electrohack, it is possible to hack the keypad.  An EMP blast has a chance to force the doors open, but it's more likely to break them.  You can also sneak in through the sewers sometimes, or try to smash through the walls with explosions, jackhammers, or high strength and a sledgehammer.",
      "Q: Why does my crafting fail so often?\nA: Check the difficulty of the recipe, and the primary skill used; your skill level should be at least the same level as the difficulty to be confident that it will succeed.",
      "Q: Why can't I carry anything?\nA: At the start of the game you only have the space in your pockets.  A good first goal of many survivors is to find a backpack or pouch to store things in.",
      "Q: Help!  I started a fire and now my house is burning down!\nA: Fires will spread to nearby flammable tiles if they are able.  Lighting a fire in a set-up brazier, stove, wood stove, stone fireplace, pit, or even in a kitchen stove will stop it from spreading.  Fire extinguishers can put out fires that get out of control.  You can put out a fire in the fireplace by examining it.",
      "Q: I'm cold and can't sleep at night!\nA: Gather some clothes and put them in the place you use to sleep in.  Being hungry, thirsty, wet, or injured can also make you feel the cold more, so try to avoid these effects before you go to sleep.  Pillows, blankets, stuffed animals, and some appliances will help you sleep, and the quality of your sleeping spot is also very important.",
      "Q: I have a question that's not addressed here. How can I get an answer?\nA: Check the hitchhiker's guide, or ask the helpful people on the discord server or the subreddit. Links are provided in MOTD in the main menu."
