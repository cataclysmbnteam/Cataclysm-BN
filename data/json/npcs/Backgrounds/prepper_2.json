When Hell itself came down from the skies and monsters started attacking the cities, I grabbed my stuff and crammed into the bunker.  My surface cameras stayed online for days; I could see everything happening up there.  I watched those things stride past.  I still have nightmares about the way their bodies moved, like they broke the world just to be here.  I had nothing better to do.  I watched them rip up the cops and the military, watched the dead rise back up and start fighting the living.  I watched the nice old lady down the street rip the head off my neighbor's dog.  I saw a soldier's body twitch and grow into some kind of electrified hulk beast.  I watched it all happen.",

I thought I wouldn't last a minute out here, but I couldn't bring myself to end it down there.  I headed out, planning to let the <zombies> finish me off, but what can I say?  Survival instinct is a funny thing, and I killed the ones outside the bunker.  I guess the adrenaline was what I needed.  It's kept me going since then.",
