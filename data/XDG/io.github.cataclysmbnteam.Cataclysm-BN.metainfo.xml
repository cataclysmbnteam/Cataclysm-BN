        <p>
            Cataclysm: Bright Nights is a roguelike with sci-fi elements set in a post-apocalyptic world.
        </p>
        <p>
            While some have described it as a &quot;zombie game&quot;, there is far more to Cataclysm than that. Struggle to survive in a harsh, persistent, procedurally generated world. Scavenge the remnants of a dead civilization for food, equipment, or, if you are lucky, a vehicle with a full tank of gas to get you the hell out of there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fight to defeat or escape from a wide variety of powerful monstrosities, from zombies to giant insects to killer robots and things far stranger and deadlier, and against the others like yourself, who want what you have.
        </p>
        <p>
            Find a way to stop the Cataclysm ... or become one of its strongest monsters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cataclysm: Bright Nights is a fork of Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead.
