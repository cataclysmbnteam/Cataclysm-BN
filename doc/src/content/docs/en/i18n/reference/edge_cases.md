title: Edge cases

There are issues specific to Cataclysm: BN which translators should be aware of. These include the
use of terms like `%s` and `%3$d` (leave them as they are), and the use of tags like `<name>`, which
shouldn't be translated.

Information about these and any other issues specific to individual languages, can be found in
Cataclysm: BN's [language notes folder][notes].

General notes for all translators are in `README_all_translators.txt`, and notes specific to a
language may be stored as `<lang_id>.txt`, for example `de.txt` for German.

Cataclysm: BN has more than 14000 translatable strings, but don't be discouraged. The more
translators there are, the easier it becomes ðŸ˜„.
