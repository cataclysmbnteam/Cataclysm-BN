title: Issues and Discussions
---

GitHub issues are used for bug reporting. For questions and feature requests, we recommend using
github discussions. Please give your issue a meaningful title as this is the first thing anyone will
see.

### Bug reports

Before submitting a bug, please search the current list of issues to see if it has been reported
already.

A bug report has to include:

- On what OS did you experience the problem (Windows, Linux, OS X etc.)
- What version were you playing:
- Tiles or Curses (text-based)
- Version string (preferably full version e.g. "0.C-4547-g3f1c109", or Jenkins build number
  e.g. 3245)
- Description of the problem written in a way that enables anyone to try and recreate it

A bug report may include:

- Screenshot(s) as some things are best explained visually
- Save file (e.g. link to a dropbox upload)

Bonus points for:

- Checking if the bug exists under latest experimental build
- Checking if it is OS specific

The OS and BN version are very important - with the pace of changes here it is possible the bug you
have encountered has already been fixed. After that reproducibility is the key, so write your report
with all the necessary details.

:::tip

All these information can be automatically filled on Debug menu. Check
[the issue form](https://github.com/cataclysmbnteam/Cataclysm-BN/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.yml)
for details.

### Enhancements and addition ideas

For ideas, we recommend using
[github discussions](https://github.com/cataclysmbnteam/Cataclysm-BN/discussions/categories/ideas)
over issues as it supports threads and voting.

Please first search if something like what you have on mind has been already proposed. If so, feel
free to join the discussion! If your idea is related but sufficiently different, open a new
discussion and refer to the older discussion (use GitHub's `#issue_number` reference system).

### Questions

It is recommended to ask questions on
[github discussions](https://github.com/cataclysmbnteam/Cataclysm-BN/discussions/categories/q-a) so
that it's easy to find them later. However, it's perfectly fine to ask questions on
[discord](https://discord.gg/XW7XhXuZ89).

:::note

If you weren't able to find an answer to your question on docs site, please open an discussion so we
could improve the docs.
