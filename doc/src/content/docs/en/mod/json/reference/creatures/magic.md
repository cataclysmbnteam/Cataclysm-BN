# Spells

In `data/mods/Magiclysm` there is a template spell, copied here for your perusal:

```json

  "max_level": 10, // maximum level you can achieve in the spell
  "min_damage": 0, // minimum damage (or "starting" damage)
  "max_damage": 100, // maximum damage the spell can achieve

  "sound_type": "combat", // the type of sound. possible types are: background, weather, music, movement, speech, activity, destructive_activity, alarm, combat, alert, order
  "sound_description": "a whoosh", // the sound description. in the form of "You hear %s" by default it is "an explosion"
  "sound_ambient": true, // whether or not this is treated as an ambient sound or not
  "sound_id": "misc", // the sound id
  "sound_variant": "shockwave" // the sound variant
}
```

Most of the default values for the above are either 0 or "NONE", so you may leave out most of the
values if they do not pertain to your spell.

When deciding values for some of these, it is important to note that some of the formulae are not
linear. For example, this is the formula for spell failure chance:

`( ( ( ( spell_level - spell_difficulty ) * 2 + intelligence + spellcraft_skill ) - 30 ) / 30 ) ^ 2`

Meaning a spell with difficulty 0 cast by a player with 8 intelligence, 0 spellcraft, and level 0 in
the spell will have a 53% spell failure chance. On the other hand, a player with 12 intelligence, 6
spellcraft, and level 6 in the same spell will have a 0% spell failure chance.

However, experience gain is a little more complicated to calculate. The formula for how much
experience you need to get to a level is below:

`e ^ ( ( level + 62.5 ) * 0.146661 ) ) - 6200`

#### Currently Implemented Effects and special rules

- `pain_split` - makes all of your limbs' damage even out.

- `move_earth` - "digs" at the target location. some terrain is not diggable this way.

- `target_attack` - deals damage to a target (ignores walls). Negative damage heals the target. If
  "effect_str" is included, it will add that effect (defined elsewhere in json) to the targets if
  able, to the body parts defined in affected_body_parts. Any aoe will manifest as a circular area
  centered on the target, and will only deal damage to valid_targets. (aoe does not ignore walls)

- `projectile_attack` - similar to target_attack, except the projectile you shoot will stop short at
  impassable terrain. If "effect_str" is included, it will add that effect (defined elsewhere in
  json) to the targets if able, to the body parts defined in affected_body_parts.

- `cone_attack` - fires a cone toward the target up to your range. The arc of the cone in degrees is
  aoe. Stops at walls. If "effect_str" is included, it will add that effect (defined elsewhere in
  json) to the targets if able, to the body parts defined in affected_body_parts.

- `line_attack` - fires a line with width aoe toward the target, being blocked by walls on the way.
  If "effect_str" is included, it will add that effect (defined elsewhere in json) to the targets if
  able, to the body parts defined in affected_body_parts.

- `spawn_item` - spawns an item that will disappear at the end of its duration. Default duration
  is 0. Damage determines quantity.

- `teleport_random` - teleports the player randomly range spaces with aoe variation

- `recover_energy` - recovers an energy source (defined in the effect_str, shown below) equal to
  damage of the spell

* "MANA"
* "STAMINA"
* "FATIGUE"
* "PAIN"
* "BIONIC"

- `ter_transform` - transform the terrain and furniture in an area centered at the target. The
  chance of any one of the points in the area of effect changing is one_in( damage ). The effect_str
  is the id of a ter_furn_transform.

- `vomit` - any creature within its area of effect will instantly vomit, if it's able to do so.

- `timed_event` - adds a timed event to the player only. valid timed events: "help", "wanted",
  "robot_attack", "spawn_wyrms", "amigara", "roots_die", "temple_open", "temple_flood",
  "temple_spawn", "dim", "artifact_light" NOTE: This was added only for artifact active effects.
  support is limited, use at your own risk.

- `explosion` - an explosion is centered on the target, with power damage() and factor aoe()/10

- `flashbang` - a flashbang effect is centered on the target, with poewr damage() and factor
  aoe()/10

- `mod_moves` - adds damage() moves to the target. can be negative to "freeze" the target for that
  amount of time

- `map` - maps the overmap centered on the player out to a radius of aoe()

- `morale` - gives a morale effect to all npcs or avatar within aoe, with value damage().
  decay_start is duration() / 10.

- `charm_monster` - charms a monster that has less hp than damage() for approximately duration()

- `mutate` - mutates the target(s). if effect_str is defined, mutates toward that category instead
  of picking at random. the "MUTATE_TRAIT" flag allows effect_str to be a specific trait instead of
  a category. damage() / 100 is the percent chance the mutation will be successful (a value of 10000
  represents 100.00%)

- `bash` - bashes the terrain at the target. uses damage() as the strength of the bash.

- `WONDER` - Unlike the above, this is not an "effect" but a "flag". This alters the behavior of the
  parent spell drastically: The spell itself doesn't cast, but its damage and range information is
  used in order to cast the extra_effects. N of the extra_effects will be chosen at random to be
  cast, where N is the current damage of the spell (stacks with RANDOM_DAMAGE flag) and the message
  of the spell cast by this spell will also be displayed. If this spell's message is not wanted to
  be displayed, make sure the message is an empty string.

- `RANDOM_TARGET` - A special spell flag (like wonder) that forces the spell to choose a random
  valid target within range instead of the caster choosing the target. This also affects
  extra_effects.

##### For Spells that have an attack type, these are the available damage types:

- `fire`
- `acid`
- `bash`
- `bio` - internal damage such as poison
- `cold`
- `cut`
- `electric`
- `stab`
- `none` - this damage type goes through armor altogether. it is the default.

#### Spells that level up

Spells that change effects as they level up must have a min and max effect and an increment. The min
effect is what the spell will do at level 0, and the max effect is where it stops growing. The
increment is how much it changes per level. For example:

```json
"min_range": 1,
"max_range": 25,
"range_increment": 5,
```

Min and max values must always have the same sign, but it can be negative eg. in the case of spells
that use a negative 'recover' effect to cause pain or stamina damage. For example:

```json
{
  "id": "stamina_damage",
  "type": "SPELL",
  "name": "Tired",
  "description": "decreases stamina",
  "valid_targets": ["hostile"],
  "min_damage": -2000,
  "max_damage": -10000,
  "damage_increment": -3000,
  "max_level": 10,
  "effect": "recover_energy",
  "effect_str": "STAMINA"
}
```

### Learning Spells

There are two ways of granting spells that is implemented: Mutating can grant a spell with the
"spells_learned" field which also lets you specify the level granted. Otherwise you can learn a
spell from an item through a use_action, which is also the only way to train a spell other than
using it. Examples of both are shown below:

```json
{
  "id": "DEBUG_spellbook",
  "type": "GENERIC",
  "name": "A Technomancer's Guide to Debugging C:DDA",
  "description": "static std::string description( spell sp ) const;",
  "weight": 1,
  "volume": "1 ml",
  "symbol": "?",
  "color": "magenta",
  "use_action": {
    "type": "learn_spell",
    "spells": [ "debug_hp", "debug_stamina", "example_template", "debug_bionic", "pain_split", "fireball" ] // this is a list of spells you can learn from the item
  }
},
```

You can study this spellbook for a rate of ~1 experience per turn depending on intelligence,
spellcraft, and focus.

```json
"spells_learned": [ [ "debug_hp", 1 ], [ "debug_stamina", 1 ], [ "example_template", 1 ], [ "pain_split", 1 ] ],
```

#### Spells in professions and NPC classes

You can add a "spell" member to professions or an NPC class definition like so:

```json
"spells": [ { "id": "summon_zombie", "level": 0 }, { "id": "magic_missile", "level": 10 } ]
```

NOTE: This makes it possible to learn spells that conflict with a class. It also does not give the
prompt to gain the class. Be judicious upon adding this to a profession!

#### Spells in monsters

You can assign a spell as a special attack for a monster.

```json
{ "type": "spell", "spell_id": "burning_hands", "spell_level": 10, "cooldown": 10 }
```

- spell_id: the id for the spell being cast.
- spell_level: the level at which the spell is cast. Spells cast by monsters do not gain levels like
  player spells.
- cooldown: how often the monster can cast this spell

# Enchantments

Enchantments make it possible to specify custom effects provided by item, bionic or mutation.

## Fields

### id

(string) Unique identifier for this enchantment.

### has

(string) How an enchantment determines if it is in the right location in order to qualify for being
active.

This field is relevant only for items.

Values:

- `HELD` (default) - when in your inventory
- `WIELD` - when wielded in your hand
- `WORN` - when worn as armor

### condition

(string) How an enchantment determines if you are in the right environments in order for the
enchantment to qualify for being active.

Values:

- `ALWAYS` (default) - Always active
- `UNDERGROUND` - When the owner of the item is below Z-level 0
- `UNDERWATER` - When the owner is in swimmable terrain
- `ACTIVE` - whenever the item, mutation, bionic, or whatever the enchantment is attached to is
  active.

### emitter

(string) Identifier of an emitter that's active as long as this enchantment is active. Default: no
emitter.

### ench_effects

(array) Grants effects of specified intensity as long as this enchantment is active.

Syntax for single entry:

```json
{
  // (required) Identifier of the effect
  "effect": "effect_identifier",

  // (required) Intensity. Setting to 1 works for effects that do not actually have intensities.
  "intensity": 2
}
```

### hit_you_effect

(array) List of spells that may be cast when enchantment is active and character melee attacks a
creature.

Syntax for single entry:

```json
{
  // (required) Identifier of the spell
  "id": "spell_identifier",

  // If true, the spell is centered on the character's location.
  // If false, the spell is centered on the attacking creature.
  // Default: false
  "hit_self": false,

  // Chance to trigger, one in X.
  // Default: 1
  "once_in": 1,

  // Message for when the spell is triggered for you.
  // %1$s is your name, %2$s is creature's
  // Default: no message
  "message": "You pierce %2$s with Magic Piercing!",

  // Message for when the spell in triggered for an NPC.
  // %1$s is their name, %2$s is creature's
  // Default: no message
  "npc_message": "%1$s pierces %2$s with Magic Piercing!",

  // TODO: broken?
  "min_level": 1,

  // TODO: broken?
  "max_level": 2
}
```

### hit_me_effect

(array) List of spells that may be cast when enchantment is active and character gets melee attacked
by a creature.

Same syntax as for `hit_you_effect`.

### mutations

(array) List of mutations temporarily granted while enchantment is active.

### intermittent_activation

(object) Rules that specify random effects which occur while enchantment is active.

Syntax:

```json
{
  // List of checks to run on every turn while enchantment is active.
  "effects": [
    {
      // Average activation frequency.
      // The exact chance to pass is "one in (X converted to turns)" per turn.
      "frequency": "5 minutes",

      // List of spells to cast if the check passed.
      "spell_effects": [
        {
          // (required) Identifier of the spell
          "id": "nasty_random_effect",

          // TODO: broken?
          "min_level": 1,

          // TODO: broken?
          "max_level": 5
          // TODO: other fields appear to be loaded, but unused
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### values

(array) List of miscellaneous character/item values to modify.

Syntax for single entry:

```json
{
  // (required) Value ID to modify, refer to list below.
  "value": "VALUE_ID_STRING",

  // Additive bonus. Optional integer number, default is 0.
  // May be ignored for some values.
  "add": 13,

  // Multiplicative bonus. Optional, default is 0.
  "multiply": -0.3
}
```

Additive bonus is applied separately from multiplicative, like so:

```json
bonus = add + base_value * multiply
```

Thus, a `multiply` value of -0.8 is -80%, and a `multiply` of 2.5 is +250%. When modifying integer
values, final bonus is rounded towards 0 (truncated).

When multiple enchantments (e.g. one from an item and one from a bionic) modify the same value,
their bonuses are added together without rounding, then the sum is rounded (if necessary) before
being applied to the base value.

Since there's no limit on number of enchantments the character can have at a time, the final
calculated values have hardcoded bounds to prevent unintended behavior.

#### IDs of modifiable values

#### Character values

##### STRENGTH

Strength stat. `base_value` here is the base stat value. The final value cannot go below 0.
