```

### Armor

Armor can be defined like this:

```json
"type" : "ARMOR",     // Defines this as armor
...                   // same entries as above for the generic item.
                      // additional some armor specific entries:

"encumbrance" : 0,    // Base encumbrance (unfitted value)
"max_encumbrance" : 0,    // When a character is completely full of volume, the encumbrance of a non-rigid storage container will be set to this. Otherwise it'll be between the encumbrance and max_encumbrance following the equation: encumbrance + (max_encumbrance - encumbrance) * character volume.
"weight_capacity_bonus": "20 kg",    // (Optional, default = 0) Bonus to weight carrying capacity, can be negative. Strings must be used - "5000 g" or "5 kg"

"valid_mods" : ["steel_padded"] // List of valid clothing mods. Note that if the clothing mod doesn't have "restricted" listed, this isn't needed.
"resistance": { "cut": 0, "bullet": 1000 } // If set, overrides usual resistance calculation. Values are for undamaged item, thickness affects scaling with damage - 1 thickness means no reduction from damage, 2 means it's halved on first damage, 10 means each level of damage decreases armor by 10%
```

Alternately, every item (book, tool, gun, even food) can be used as armor if it has armor_data:

```json
"type" : "TOOL",      // Or any other item type
...                   // same entries as for the type (e.g. same entries as for any tool),
"armor_data" : {      // additionally the same armor data like above
    "covers" : ["FEET"],
    "storage" : 0,
    "warmth" : 10,
    "environmental_protection" : 0,
    "encumbrance" : 0,
    "coverage" : 80,
    "material_thickness" : 1,
    "power_armor" : false
}
```

### Pet Armor

Pet armor can be defined like this:

```json
"type" : "PET_ARMOR",     // Defines this as armor
...                   // same entries as above for the generic item.
                      // additional some armor specific entries:
"storage" : 0,        //  (Optional, default = 0) How many volume storage slots it adds
"environmental_protection" : 0,  //  (Optional, default = 0) How much environmental protection it affords
"material_thickness" : 1,  // Thickness of material, in millimeter units (approximately).  Generally ranges between 1 - 5, more unusual armor types go up to 10 or more
"pet_bodytype":        // the body type of the pet that this monster will fit.  See MONSTERS.md
"max_pet_vol:          // the maximum volume of the pet that will fit into this armor. Volume in ml and L can be used - "50 ml" or "2 L".
"min_pet_vol:          // the minimum volume of the pet that will fit into this armor. Volume in ml and L can be used - "50 ml" or "2 L".
"power_armor" : false, // If this is a power armor item (those are special).
```

Alternately, every item (book, tool, gun, even food) can be used as armor if it has armor_data:

```json
"type" : "TOOL",      // Or any other item type
...                   // same entries as for the type (e.g. same entries as for any tool),
"pet_armor_data" : {      // additionally the same armor data like above
    "storage" : 0,
    "environmental_protection" : 0,
    "pet_bodytype": "dog",
    "max_pet_vol": "35000 ml",
    "min_pet_vol": "25000 ml",
    "material_thickness" : 1,
    "power_armor" : false
}
```

### Books

Books can be defined like this:

```json
"type" : "BOOK",      // Defines this as a BOOK
...                   // same entries as above for the generic item.
                      // additional some book specific entries:
"max_level" : 5,      // Maximum skill level this book will train to
"intelligence" : 11,  // Intelligence required to read this book without penalty
"time" : "35 m",          // Time a single read session takes. An integer will be read in minutes or a time string can be used.
"fun" : -2,           // Morale bonus/penalty for reading
"skill" : "computer", // Skill raised
"chapters" : 4,       // Number of chapters (for fun only books), each reading "consumes" a chapter. Books with no chapters left are less fun (because the content is already known to the character).
"required_level" : 2  // Minimum skill level required to learn
```

Alternately, every item (tool, gun, even food) can be used as book if it has book_data:

```json
"type" : "TOOL",      // Or any other item type
...                   // same entries as for the type (e.g. same entries as for any tool),
"book_data" : {       // additionally the same book data like above
    "max_level" : 5,
    "intelligence" : 11,
    "time" : 35,
    "fun" : -2,
    "skill" : "computer",
    "chapters" : 4,
    "use_action" : "MA_MANUAL", // The book_data can have use functions (see USE ACTIONS) that are triggered when the books has been read. These functions are not triggered by simply activating the item (like tools would).
    "required_level" : 2
}
```

Since many book names are proper names, it's often necessary to explicitly specify the plural forms.
The following is the game's convention on plural names of books:

1. For non-periodical books (textbooks, manuals, spellbooks, etc.),
   1. If the book's singular name is a proper name, then the plural name is
      `copies of (singular name)`. For example, the plural name of
      `Lessons for the Novice Bowhunter` is `copies of Lessons for the Novice Bowhunter`.
   2. Otherwise, the plural name is the usual plural of the singular name. For example, the plural
      name of `tactical baton defense manual` is `tactical baton defense manuals`
2. For periodicals (magazines and journals),
   1. If the periodical's singular name is a proper name, and doesn't end with "Magazine", "Weekly",
      "Monthly", etc., the plural name is `issues of (singular name)`. For example, the plural name
      of `Archery for Kids` is `issues of Archery for Kids`.
   2. Otherwise, the periodical's plural name is the usual plural of the singular name. For example,
      the plural name of `Crafty Crafter's Quarterly` is `Crafty Crafter's Quarterlies`.
3. For board games (represented internally as book items),
   1. If the board game's singular name is a proper name, the plural is `sets of (singular name)`.
      For example, the plural name of `Picturesque` is `sets of Picturesque`.
   2. Otherwise the plural name is the usual plural. For example, the plural of `deck of cards` is
      `decks of cards`.

#### Conditional Naming

The `conditional_names` field allows defining alternate names for items that will be displayed
instead of (or in addition to) the default name, when specific conditions are met. Take the
following (incomplete) definition for `sausage` as an example of the syntax:

```json
{
  "name": "sausage",
  "conditional_names": [
    {
      "type": "FLAG",
      "condition": "CANNIBALISM",
      "name": "Mannwurst"
    },
    {
      "type": "COMPONENT_ID",
      "condition": "mutant",
      "name": { "str_sp": "sinister %s" }
    }
  ]
}
```

You can list as many conditional names for a given item as you want. Each conditional name must
consist of 3 elements:

1. The condition type:
   - `COMPONENT_ID` searches all the components of the item (and all of _their_ components, and so
     on) for an item with the condition string in their ID. The ID only needs to _contain_ the
     condition, not match it perfectly (though it is case sensitive). For example, supplying a
     condition `mutant` would match `mutant_meat`.
   - `FLAG` which checks if an item has the specified flag (exact match).
2. The condition you want to look for.
3. The name to use if a match is found. Follows all the rules of a standard `name` field, with valid
   keys being `str`, `str_pl`, and `ctxt`. You may use %s here, which will be replaced by the name
   of the item. Conditional names defined prior to this one are taken into account.

So, in the above example, if the sausage is made from mutant humanoid meat, and therefore both has
the `CANNIBALISM` flag, _and_ has a component with `mutant` in its ID:

1. First, the item name is entirely replaced with "Mannwurst" if singular, or "Mannwursts" if
   plural.
2. Next, it is replaced by "sinister %s", but %s is replaced with the name as it was before this
   step, resulting in "sinister Mannwurst" or "sinister Mannwursts".

NB: If `"str": "sinister %s"` was specified instead of `"str_sp": "sinister %s"`, the plural form
would be automatically created as "sinister %ss", which would become "sinister Mannwurstss" which is
of course one S too far. Rule of thumb: If you are using %s in the name, always specify an identical
plural form unless you know exactly what you're doing!

#### Color Key

When adding a new book, please use this color key:

- Magazines: `pink`
- “Paperbacks” Short enjoyment books (including novels): `light_cyan`
- “Hardbacks” Long enjoyment books (including novels): `light_blue`
- “Small textbook” Beginner level textbooks, guides and martial arts books: `green`
- “Large textbook” Advanced level textbooks and advanced guides: `blue`
- Religious books: `dark_gray`
- “Printouts” (including spiral-bound, binders, and similar) Technical documents, (technical?)
  protocols, (lab) journals, personal diaries: `light_green`
- Other reading material/non-books (use only if every other category does not apply): `light_gray`

A few exceptions to this color key may apply, for example for books that don’t are what they seem to
be. Never use `yellow` and `red`, those colors are reserved for sounds and infrared vision.

####CBMs

CBMs can be defined like this:

```json
"type" : "BIONIC_ITEM",         // Defines this as a CBM
...                             // same entries as above for the generic item.
                                // additional some CBM specific entries:
"bionic_id" : "bio_advreactor", // ID of the installed bionic if not equivalent to "id"
"difficulty" : 11,              // Difficulty of installing CBM
"is_upgrade" : true             // Whether the CBM is an upgrade of another bionic.
"installation_data" : "AID_bio_advreactor" // ID of the item which allows for almost guaranteed installation of corresponding bionic.

"stack_size" : 8,           // (Optional) How many uses are in the above-defined volume. If omitted, is the same as 'charges'
"fun" : 50                  // Morale effects when used
"cooks_like": "meat_cooked" // (Optional) If the item is used in a recipe, replaces it with its cooks_like
"parasites": 10,            // (Optional) Probability of becoming parasitised when eating
"contamination": [ { "disease": "bad_food", "probability": 5 } ],         // (Optional) List of diseases carried by this comestible and their associated probability. Values must be in the [0, 100] range.
```

### Containers

```json
"type": "CONTAINER",  // Defines this as a container
...                   // same data as for the generic item (see above).
"contains": 200,      // How much volume this container can hold
"seals": false,       // Can be resealed, this is a required for it to be used for liquids. (optional, default: false)
"watertight": false,  // Can hold liquids, this is a required for it to be used for liquids. (optional, default: false)
"preserves": false,   // Contents do not spoil. (optional, default: false)
```

Alternately, every item can be used as container:

```json
"type": "ARMOR",      // Any type is allowed here
...                   // same data as for the type
"container_data" : {  // The container specific data goes here.
    "contains": 200,
}
```

This defines a armor (you need to add all the armor specific entries), but makes it usable as
container. It could also be written as a generic item ("type": "GENERIC") with "armor_data" and
"container_data" entries.

### Gun

Guns can be defined like this:

```json
"type": "GUN",             // Defines this as a GUN
...                        // same entries as above for the generic item.
                           // additional some gun specific entries:
"skill": "pistol",         // Skill used for firing
"ammo": [ "357", "38" ],   // Ammo types accepted for reloading
"ranged_damage": 0,        // Ranged damage when fired
"range": 0,                // Range when fired
"dispersion": 32,          // Inaccuracy of gun, measured in quarter-degrees
// When sight_dispersion and aim_speed are present in a gun mod, the aiming system picks the "best"
// sight to use for each aim action, which is the fastest sight with a dispersion under the current
// aim threshold.
"sight_dispersion": 10,    // Inaccuracy of gun derived from the sight mechanism, also in quarter-degrees
"aim_speed": 3,            // A measure of how quickly the player can aim, in moves per point of dispersion.
"recoil": 0,               // Recoil caused when firing, in quarter-degrees of dispersion.
"durability": 8,           // Resistance to damage/rusting, also determines misfire chance
"blackpowder_tolerance": 8,// One in X chance to get clogged up (per shot) when firing blackpowder ammunition (higher is better). Optional, default is 8.
"min_cycle_recoil": 0,     // Minimum ammo recoil for gun to be able to fire more than once per attack.
"burst": 5,                // Number of shots fired in burst mode
"handling": 15,            // Modifier in how quick the gun recovers from recoil. 20 is baseline, below that is worse and above is better. Scales with '2 - 2.0 => 0' by default, for example 15 handling would be '2 - 1.5 => 0.5' increase to recoil and 30 would be '2 - 3.0 => -1' reduction to recoil
"clip_size": 100,          // Maximum amount of ammo that can be loaded
"ups_charges": 0,          // Additionally to the normal ammo (if any), a gun can require some charges from an UPS. This also works on mods. Attaching a mod with ups_charges will add/increase ups drain on the weapon.
"ammo_to_fire" 1,          // Amount of ammo used per shot, separate from any UPS cost that may be given to the weapon.
// The legacy item flags `FIRE_20`, `FIRE_50`, and `FIRE_100` are still permitted and will override `ammo_to_fire` if present.
"reload": 450,             // Amount of time to reload, 100 = 1 second = 1 "turn". Default 100.
"built_in_mods": ["m203"], // An array of mods that will be integrated in the weapon using the IRREMOVABLE tag.
"default_mods": ["m203"]   // An array of mods that will be added to a weapon on spawn.
"barrel_length": "30 mL",  // Amount of volume lost when the barrel is sawn. Approximately 250 ml per inch is a decent approximation.
"valid_mod_locations": [ [ "accessories", 4 ], [ "grip", 1 ] ],  // The valid locations for gunmods and the mount of slots for that location.
```

Alternately, every item (book, tool, armor, even food) can be used as gun if it has gun_data:

```json
"type": "TOOL",      // Or any other item type
...                   // same entries as for the type (e.g. same entries as for any tool),
"gun_data" : {        // additionally the same gun data like above

    ...
}

### Seed Data

Every item type can have optional seed data, if the item has seed data, it's considered a seed and
can be planted:

```json
"seed_data" : {
    "fruit": "weed", // The item id of the fruits that this seed will produce.
    "seeds": false, // (optional, default is true). If true, harvesting the plant will spawn seeds (the same type as the item used to plant). If false only the fruits are spawned, no seeds.

                // Note that growing time is later converted based upon the season_length option, basing it around 91 is just for accuracy purposes
                // A value 91 means 3 full seasons, a value of 30 would mean 1 season.
    "required_terrain_flag": "PLANTABLE" // A tag that terrain and furniture would need to have in order for the seed to be plantable there.

					 // Using any other tag will not turn the terrain into dirt.
}
```

### Brewing Data

Every item type can have optional brewing data, if the item has brewing data, it can be placed in a
vat and will ferment into a different item type.

Currently only vats can only accept and produce liquid items.

```json
"brewable" : {
    "time": 3600, // A time duration: how long the fermentation will take.
    "result": "beer" // The id of the result of the fermentation.
}
```

### Software Data

Every item type can have software data, it does not have any behavior:

```json
"software_data" : {
    "type": "USELESS", // unused
    "power" : 91 // unused
}
```

### Fuel data

Every item type can have fuel data that determines how much horse power it produces per unit
consumed. Currently, gasses and plasmas cannot really be fuels.

If a fuel has the PERPETUAL flag, engines powered by it never use any fuel. This is primarily
intended for the muscle pseudo-fuel, but mods may take advantage of it to make perpetual motion
machines.

```json
"fuel" : {
    energy": 34.2,               // battery charges per mL of fuel. batteries have energy 1
                                 // is also MJ/L from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density
                                 // assumes stacksize 250 per volume 1 (250mL). Multiply
                                 // by 250 / stacksize * volume for other stack sizes and
                                 // volumes
   "pump_terrain": "t_gas_pump", // optional. terrain id for the fuel's pump, if any.
   "explosion_data": {           // optional for fuels that can cause explosions
        "chance_hot": 2,         // 1 in chance_hot of explosion when attacked by HEAT weapons
        "chance_cold": 5,        // 1 in chance_cold of explosion when attacked by other weapons
        "factor": 1.0,           // explosion factor - larger numbers create more powerful explosions
        "fiery": true,           // true for fiery explosions
        "size_factor": 0.1       // size factor - larger numbers make the remaining fuel increase explosion power more
    }
}
```

### Use Actions

The contents of use_action fields can either be a string indicating a built-in function to call when
the item is activated (defined in iuse.cpp), or one of several special definitions that invoke a
more structured function.

### Random Descriptions

Any item with a "snippet_category" entry will have random descriptions, based on that snippet
category:

```
"snippet_category": "newspaper",
```

The item descriptions are taken from snippets, which can be specified like this (the value of
category must match the snippet_category in the item definition):

```json
{
  "type": "snippet",
  "category": "newspaper",
  "id": "snippet-id", // id is optional, it's used when the snippet is referenced in the item list of professions
  "text": "your flavor text"
}
```

or several snippets at once:

```json
{
  "type": "snippet",
  "category": "newspaper",
  "text": [
    "your flavor text",
    "more flavor",
    // entries can also bo of this form to have a id to reference that specific snippet.
    { "id": "snippet-id", "text": "another flavor text" }
  ],
  "text": ["your flavor text", "another flavor text", "more flavor"]
}
```

Multiple snippets for the same category are possible and actually recommended. The game will select
a random one for each item of that type.

One can also put the snippets directly in the item definition:

```
"snippet_category": [ "text 1", "text 2", "text 3" ],
```

This will automatically create a snippet category specific to that item and populate that category
with the given snippets. The format also support snippet ids like above.
