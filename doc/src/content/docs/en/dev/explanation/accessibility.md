title: Compatibility with screen readers
---

There are people who use screen readers to play Cataclysm Bright Nights. In order for screen readers
to announce the most important information in a UI, the terminal cursor has to be placed at the
correct location. This information may be text such as selected item names in a list, etc, and the
cursor has to be placed exactly at the beginning of the text for screen readers to announce it.

The recommended way to place the cursor is to use `ui_adaptor`. This ensures the desired cursor
position is preserved when subsequent output code changes the cursor position. You can call
`ui_adaptor::set_cursor` and similar methods at any position in a redrawing callback, and the last
cursor position of the topmost UI set via the call will be used as the final cursor position. You
can also call `ui_adaptor::disable_cursor` to prevent a UI's cursor from being used as the final
cursor position.
