I appreciate help, especially with:

- Reporting bugs. Including ones inherited from DDA.
- Identifying problems that aren't bugs. Misleading descriptions, values that are clearly off
  compared to similar cases, grammar mistakes, UI wonkiness that has an obvious solution.
- Making useless things useful or putting them on a blacklist. Adding deconstruction recipes for
  things that should have them but don't, replacing completely redundant items with their generic
  versions (say, "tiny marked bottle" with just "tiny bottle") in spawn lists.
- Tileset work. I'm occasionally adding new objects, like the new electric grid elements, and they
  could use new tiles.
- Balance analysis. Those should be rather in depth or "obviously correct". Obviously correct would
  be things like: "weapon x has strictly better stats than y, but y requires rarer components and
  has otherwise identical requirements".
- Identifying performance bottlenecks with a profiler.
- Code quality help.
