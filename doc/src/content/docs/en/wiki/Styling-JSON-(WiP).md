### One file

To style one JSON file you can run `json_formatter.exe path/to/file.json`. This will style that one
file. If it prints "needs linting", the file wasn't styled, but now should be. You can use
drag&drop: drag the json file onto the `json_formatter` icon, then wait a few seconds.

### TODO: Script that styles everything

TODO

# *nix

Run `make style-json` in main repo directory.
