Cataclysm: Bright Nights is a roguelike with sci-fi elements set in a post-apocalyptic world.

While some have described it as a "zombie game", there is far more to Cataclysm than that. Struggle to survive in a harsh, persistent, procedurally generated world. Scavenge the remnants of a dead civilization for food, equipment, or, if you are lucky, a vehicle with a full tank of gas to get you the hell out of there.

Fight to defeat or escape from a wide variety of powerful monstrosities, from zombies to giant insects to killer robots and things far stranger and deadlier, and against the others like yourself, who want what you have.

Find a way to stop the Cataclysm ... or become one of its strongest monsters.

> Cataclysm: Bright Nights is a fork of Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead.
